# Welcome to swag documentation.
## What is a swag framework?
It's an **ideology**. The ideology of manual control, the ideology of extensibility.
Swag is a minimalistic framework. It has no dependencies except for one - Python.

Swag currently does not support such cool things as:


- HTTPS
* async
* path queries such as ?value=69

But, it does support HTTP, and placeholders for routes.
### Anyway, let's go!
(but keep in mind that this framework dont done at this moment, and not production ready, you can use it for play with sockets and http)
